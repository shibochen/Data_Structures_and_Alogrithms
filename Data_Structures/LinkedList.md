# Linked List

A `Linked List` is a linear data structure in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.

## Types of Linked List

1. Singly Linked List
2. Doubly Linked List
3. Circular Linked List

## Singly Linked List

A `Single Linked List` is a sequence of elements in which every element has link to its next element in the sequence

Each node in a list consists of two parts:

1. **data** : store actual value of the node
2. **pointer** : store the address of next node in the memory

## Doubly Linked List

A `Doubly Linked List` is a sequence of elements in which every element has links to its previous element and next element in sequence

## Circular Linked List

A `Circular Linked List` is a sequence of elements in which every element has a link to its next element in the sequence and the last element has a link to the first element
