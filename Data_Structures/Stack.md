# Stack

`stack` is a linear data structure in which the insertion and deletions are performed based on **LIFO(Last In, First Out)** or **FILO(First In, Last Out)** principle.

Stack data structure can be implement in two ways. They are as follows...
1. Using Array
2. Using Linked List

When stack is implemented using array, that stack can organize only limited number of elements. When stack is implemented using linked list, that stack can organize unlimited number of elements.
