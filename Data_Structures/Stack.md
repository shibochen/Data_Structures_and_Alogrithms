# Stack

`Stack` is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on **LIFO(Last In, First Out)** or **FILO(First In, Last Out)** principle.

## Implementation

There are two ways to implement a stack:

1. Using Array
2. Using Linked List

When stack is implemented using array, that stack can organize only limited number of elements. When stack is implemented using linked list, that stack can organize unlimited number of elements.

## Basic Methods

- **Push**
- **Pop**
- **Peek**
- **isEmpty**

All methods take O(1) time
