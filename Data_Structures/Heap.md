# Heap

A `Heap` is a special tree-based data structure in which the tree is a complete binary tree.

## Types of Heap

1. **Max Heap** : In a Max-Heap, the key present at the root node must be greatest among the keys present at all of it's children
2. **Min Heap** : In a Min-Heap, the key present at the root node must be minimum among the keys present at all of it's children.

## Every heap data structure has the following properties

- **Property #1**: Nodes must be arranged in an order according to their values based on Max heap or Min heap
- **Property #2**: All levels in a heap must be full except the last level and all nodes must be filled from left to right strictly
