# Arrays
**Array** stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. An array is used to store a collection of data (variables of the same type).

If array is sorted, binary search is more efficient than linear search for finding an element in the array. 

There are many strategies for sorting elements in an array. Selection sort and insertion sort are two common approaches.
